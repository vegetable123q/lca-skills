    "\n"
    "Goal:\n"
    "- Choose at most one UUID from candidates, or null if none is appropriate.\n"
    "\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- The selected UUID MUST be from the provided candidates list.\n"
    "- Prefer semantic consistency with exchange_name/description and constraints: flow_type, direction, io_kind, unit, compartment.\n"
    "- If CAS is provided in the query and candidate CAS exists, prefer exact CAS match.\n"
    "- If no candidate is clearly valid, return null.\n"

    "- Step 1 (technology routes): concrete descriptions of production/treatment routes or major process stages.\n"
    "- Step 2 (unit process split): explicit unit operations, process sequences, or intermediate products.\n"
    "- Step 3 (exchanges): inventory inputs/outputs, emissions, resources, or quantified exchanges.\n"
    "\n"
    "Decision rules:\n"
    "- Mark 'usable' only if the article provides process-level or inventory details that can support at least one step above.\n"
    "- Mark 'unusable' if it only reports LCIA impact indicators (ADP/AP/GWP/EP/PED/RI) or impact units like 'kg CO2 eq' "
    "without any LCI inventory tables/rows showing physical flows (kg, g, t, m2, m3, pcs, kWh, MJ as inventory).\n"
    "- Mark 'unusable' if it is background-only (policy, market, nutrition/health, generic LCA discussion) without process/inventory detail.\n"
    "- Record si_hint as likely/possible/none when the text points to supporting information, supplementary material, or appendices "
    "that may contain inventory tables; keep decision=unusable unless the main text itself includes LCI tables.\n"
    "- If evidence is weak or indirect, choose 'unusable' and explain the gap.\n"

    "- background_only: background context only; no direct support for Steps 1-3.\n"
    "\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Pick all that apply, but never include background_only with other tags.\n"
    "- Use fulltext and SI snippets if available.\n"
    "- If evidence is weak or absent, return background_only.\n"
