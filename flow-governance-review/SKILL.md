description: "Run the CLI-backed flow governance commands for review, remediation, deterministic process-flow repair, and publish preparation. Use `node scripts/run-flow-governance-review.mjs COMMAND ...` when you need the supported `tiangong-lca review flow` and `tiangong-lca flow ...` workflows from a skill wrapper."

# Flow Governance Review

Keep local JSON or JSONL payloads as the system of record. This skill is a thin wrapper around the supported CLI governance commands.

Do not use this skill for:

- arbitrary remote CRUD outside the explicit CLI commit commands
- hidden OpenClaw orchestration
- private Python remediation helpers
- remote scope export

## Runtime Model

- The canonical entrypoint is `node scripts/run-flow-governance-review.mjs <command> ...`.
- Write outputs to an explicit directory such as `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/...`.
- Supported commands are all CLI-backed:
  - `review-flows` -> `tiangong-lca review flow`
  - `flow-get` -> `tiangong-lca flow get`
  - `flow-list` -> `tiangong-lca flow list`
  - `materialize-db-flows` -> `tiangong-lca flow fetch-rows`
  - `materialize-approved-decisions` -> `tiangong-lca flow materialize-decisions`
  - `remediate-flows` -> `tiangong-lca flow remediate`
  - `publish-version` -> `tiangong-lca flow publish-version`
  - `publish-reviewed-data` -> `tiangong-lca flow publish-reviewed-data`
  - `build-flow-alias-map` -> `tiangong-lca flow build-alias-map`
  - `scan-process-flow-refs` -> `tiangong-lca flow scan-process-flow-refs`
  - `plan-process-flow-repairs` -> `tiangong-lca flow plan-process-flow-repairs`
  - `apply-process-flow-repairs` -> `tiangong-lca flow apply-process-flow-repairs`
  - `regen-product` -> `tiangong-lca flow regen-product`
  - `validate-processes` -> `tiangong-lca flow validate-processes`
- `publish-reviewed-data` is fully CLI-owned for both local preparation and commit-time process publish.
- There is no Python fallback path and no shell compatibility shim.

## Commands

- `flow-get`
- `flow-list`
- `materialize-db-flows`
- `materialize-approved-decisions`
- `remediate-flows`
- `publish-version`
- `publish-reviewed-data`
- `build-flow-alias-map`
- `scan-process-flow-refs`
- `plan-process-flow-repairs`
- `apply-process-flow-repairs`
- `regen-product`
- `validate-processes`
- `review-flows`

Run them through:

```bash
node scripts/run-flow-governance-review.mjs <command> ...
```

For CLI-backed deterministic governance slices, prefer:

```bash

  --refs-file /abs/path/flow-refs.json \
  --out-dir /abs/path/materialized \

```

## Not Supported

The following legacy commands were intentionally removed with the Python runtime:

- `openclaw-entry`
- `openclaw-full-run`
- `run-governance`
- `flow-dedup-candidates`
- `export-openclaw-*`
- `apply-openclaw-*`
- `validate-openclaw-*`

If you need one of those workflows, add it first as a native `tiangong-lca review ...` or `tiangong-lca flow ...` command instead of rebuilding it inside this skill.

## Preferred Usage

Use the supported commands as composable slices:

1. `materialize-db-flows` when the task must bind to real DB rows
2. `review-flows`
3. `materialize-approved-decisions` after merge decisions are approved
4. `remediate-flows`
5. `build-flow-alias-map` when version cleanup produced old/new scopes
6. `scan-process-flow-refs`
7. `plan-process-flow-repairs`
8. `apply-process-flow-repairs`
9. `validate-processes`
10. `publish-version` or `publish-reviewed-data`

## Standard Outputs

- `flow-alias-map.json` when alias building is applicable
- `scan-findings.json` and `repair-summary.json` when process snapshots are provided
- `publish-report.json` from `publish-reviewed-data`
- `prepared-flow-rows.json` and `flow-version-map.json` from `publish-reviewed-data`
- `skipped-unchanged-flow-rows.json` from `publish-reviewed-data` when `--original-flow-rows-file` is provided
- `resolved-flow-rows.jsonl`, `review-input-rows.jsonl`, and `fetch-summary.json` from `materialize-db-flows`
- `flow-dedup-canonical-map.json`, `flow-dedup-rewrite-plan.json`, `manual-semantic-merge-seed.current.json`, and `blocked-clusters.json` from `materialize-approved-decisions`

## Example Output Layout

Write generated machine outputs to an explicit directory outside the skill source tree. Typical bundles include:

- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-processing/datasets/`: shared flow pool, invalid-input scope, resolved flow pool, reusable `process_pool.jsonl`
- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-processing/validation/`: grouped validation failures that still matter for remediation planning
- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-processing/naming/remaining-after-aggressive/`: post-aggressive completeness summaries and zero-process residuals
- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-processing/naming/zero-process-completion-pack/`: reference review materials retained for follow-up
- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-processing/remediation/`: deterministic remediation and publish preparation artifacts
- `/abs/path/artifacts/<case_slug>/flow-remediation-batch-smoketest/`: historical smoke-test evidence for remediation-helper startup checks

## Load References On Demand

- `references/workflow.md`: command matrix, outputs, removed surface, and recommended sequencing.
