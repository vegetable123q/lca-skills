# Workflow

## Purpose

This skill exposes only the CLI-backed governance slices that still exist in the workspace. It is a local-first wrapper layer, not a second orchestration runtime.

## Runtime Model

- Entry point: `node scripts/run-flow-governance-review.mjs <command> ...`
- Wrapper role:
  - launch `npx -y @tiangong-lca/cli@latest` by default
  - honor `TIANGONG_LCA_CLI_DIR` / `--cli-dir` only as a local dev/CI override
  - forward arguments to `tiangong`
  - expose no Python fallback path
- Command ownership:
  - review lives in `tiangong review flow`
  - read/repair/publish slices live in `tiangong flow ...`

## Supported Commands

Run these through the wrapper:

```bash
node scripts/run-flow-governance-review.mjs <command> ...
```

Supported commands:

- `review-flows`
- `flow-get`
- `flow-list`
- `materialize-db-flows`
- `materialize-approved-decisions`
- `remediate-flows`
- `publish-version`
- `publish-reviewed-data`
- `build-flow-alias-map`
- `scan-process-flow-refs`
- `plan-process-flow-repairs`
- `apply-process-flow-repairs`
- `regen-product`
- `validate-processes`

## Removed Surface

The previous Python/OpenClaw orchestration layer was intentionally removed.

Not available anymore:

- `openclaw-entry`
- `openclaw-full-run`
- `run-governance`
- `flow-dedup-candidates`
- `export-openclaw-*`
- `apply-openclaw-*`
- `validate-openclaw-*`

If any of these workflows is required again, add a native `tiangong` command first and then reintroduce a thin wrapper.

## Recommended Sequences

### Review And Publish Flows

When the task must bind to real DB flow rows:

1. `materialize-db-flows`
2. `review-flows`
3. `materialize-approved-decisions`
4. `remediate-flows`
5. `publish-version` or `publish-reviewed-data`

When the task is already grounded on an existing local reviewed-row snapshot:

1. `review-flows`
2. `remediate-flows`
3. `publish-version` or `publish-reviewed-data`

### Repair Process Flow References

1. `scan-process-flow-refs`
2. `plan-process-flow-repairs`
3. `apply-process-flow-repairs`
4. `validate-processes`
5. `publish-reviewed-data` when local review decisions are complete

### Alias Map After Cleanup

1. `build-flow-alias-map`
2. `scan-process-flow-refs`
3. `plan-process-flow-repairs`

## Artifact Layout

Persistent machine outputs belong under:

- `assets/artifacts/flow-processing/datasets/`
- `assets/artifacts/flow-processing/validation/`
- `assets/artifacts/flow-processing/naming/`
- `assets/artifacts/flow-processing/remediation/`

Do not reintroduce these artifacts under `docs/`.

## Guardrails

- Keep local JSON/JSONL payloads as the system of record.
- Use explicit CLI read/commit commands for remote interaction.
- If the task requires real DB binding, materialize DB rows first and do not substitute synthetic rows.
- If merge decisions were approved, materialize them through `materialize-approved-decisions` before alias or process-repair planning.
- Do not add helper scripts, private env parsing, or hidden transport logic back into this skill.
